  Permutations are modelled as distinct lists over some set in this formalization. That means both
  the arrival order of the online vertices $U$ and the (later random) ordering of the offline
  vertices $V$ are modelled as lists. We don't require \<^term>\<open>distinct\<close>ness for the most part in
  the combinatorial part, but rely quite heavily on it in the probabilistic part.

  To obtain an ordering from a list we use the \<^theory>\<open>List-Index.List_Index\<close> AFP entry by
  Nipkow~\cite{List-Index-AFP}.

  An important strategy to prove properties of matchings produced by RANKING is by contradiction
  through construction of an infinite chain of vertices with decreasing (or increasing) index.
  The following two induction schemes are useful to this end. Of course, they are also useful
  on their own as specialized forms of strong induction.

subsubsection \<open>Moving a vertex to a position\<close>
text \<open>
  Moving vertices to some index plays a crucial role in the probabilistic part of the proof.
  It is used to argue about the probability of the vertex at index $t$ being matched. Moving an
  arbitrary vertex to index $t$ in an arbitrary permutation $\sigma$ is needed to ensure the
  independence of certain events.
