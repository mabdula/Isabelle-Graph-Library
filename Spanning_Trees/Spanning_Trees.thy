definition "has_no_cycle X = ( X \<subseteq> G \<and> (\<nexists>u c. decycle X u c))"

text \<open>We prove that in an undirected graph, the property of having no cycles forms a matroid
(the graphic/cycle matroid), with the carrier set being the set of edges of the graph and the
independence function being the function has_no_cycle.\<close>
