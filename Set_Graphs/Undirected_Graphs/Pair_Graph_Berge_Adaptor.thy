subsection \<open>Directed-Undirected Graph Adaptor\<close>
text \<open>Here we have adaptors between directed and undirected graphs. These are for the concepts of 
      paths.

      We have used the adaptor to derive some lemmas on undirected graphs from the corresponding 
      lemmas on directed graphs.\<close>

  a list of pairs. Dealing with the interaction between these doubleton sets and pairs
