- move to_dbltn, or reuse an equivalent definition from Undirected Graphs. 
      (there is to_dbltn in Jarnik Prim, set_of_pair in Pair_Graph_U_Specs, an assumed to_dbltn in Max_Bipartite_Matching)
- intro and elim rule for every definition
- no unnamed contexts in matroids, greedoids
- vwalk_bet and walk_betw: we need to have better names

- add Hypergraphs 
- move Pair_ugraph to undirected graph.

- Separate session for graphs to LPs
- Unify notion of graph difference, move to graph library
- Unify notion of perfect matching, move to matching session (Berge's lemma now)


- Add adaptor for Wimmer's graph library
- add tsp approximation and complexity
